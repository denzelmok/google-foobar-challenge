Google's foobar coding challenge, with questions requiring a solid understanding of mathematical concepts and computer science algorithms. The early levels could be solved by beginner/novice coders, with levels 3+ requiring an intermediate or strong understanding.

### Heading 3 ###

##minion-labor-shifts##
the question requires the filtering of recurring numbers (shifts) above the specified number

gearing-up-for-destruction: given a list of gears and their distance between each other, you are required to find the size of the gears

ion-flux-relabeling: given a perfect binary tree with post-order traversal, find the parent of a given node

doomsday-fuel: given a list of probability states, find the probability of the terminal states (absorbing states)

find-the-access-codes: find the number of "lucky triples" in a list, a "lucky triple" is a tuple (x,y,z), where x divides y and y divides z

bomb-baby: find the number of steps/cycles to achieve two given numbers, starting from 1,1
